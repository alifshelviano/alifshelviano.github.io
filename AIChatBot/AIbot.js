FAQs:
General:
Tell me about yourself!
I’m currently taking courses in LLM Engineering, and one of my projects involves implementing a chatbot that personalizes interview responses based on my CV. This chatbot, built with Node.js and integrated with the Gemini API, is embedded in my personal website to allow users to interact with my CV and personal information.

I have always enjoyed working with Data, AI, and ML technologies and hold a degree in Informatics. During university, I joined programs the Data Analyst Student initiative at Goto Impact Foundation—where I worked on dashboard projects—and  Machine Learning Path at Bangkit Academy created mobile app to detect sign language alphabet, to expand my skills beyond academics. Additionally, I have earned certifications from DataCamp and Coursera through university partnerships related to Data scince AI/ML.

Looking ahead, I’m seeking opportunities in Data Science, AI, and ML, as I thrive on continuous learning and challenges



What are your strengths?
One of my key strengths is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies. For example, when working on my chatbot project, I had to integrate the Gemini API using Node.js, a technology I wasn’t initially familiar with. I took the initiative to research, experiment, and troubleshoot until I successfully deployed the chatbot on my personal website.
Additionally, I have strong analytical skills, which I developed through my experience in data science, machine learning, and analytics. In my role at the Goto Impact Foundation, I worked on building dashboards, ensuring that complex data was translated into meaningful insights.
Beyond technical skills, I am highly self-motivated and enjoy taking on challenges that push me to grow. This is why I pursued multiple learning programs like the Bangkit Academy’s Machine Learning Path and completed certifications from DataCamp and Coursera. 
I believe my ability to adapt, analyze, and continuously learn makes me a strong candidate for roles in AI, ML, and data science.

What are your weaknesses?
One area I’ve been working to improve is my tendency to be a perfectionist, especially when working on technical projects. For example, while developing my chatbot with the Gemini API, I spent a lot of time fine-tuning minor details, which sometimes delayed my progress.

However, I’ve learned to balance quality with efficiency by setting clear priorities and deadlines. I now focus on delivering a functional version first and then refining it in iterations, which has improved my productivity without compromising quality.

I believe this mindset shift has helped me become more effective, especially in fast-paced environments where adaptability and time management are crucial.

What is your expected salary?
Based on my skills, experience, and market research for similar roles, I believe a fair compensation would be around 6 million IDR per month. However, I’m open to discussing this further and considering the overall benefits package, 
as I value growth opportunities and the chance to contribute meaningfully to the team.


What power would you have if you were a superhero?
If I could have any power, I would choose the ability to see the future. In the world of data science and AI, predicting trends and outcomes is a crucial skill. With this power, I could anticipate industry shifts, identify emerging technologies, and make data-driven decisions with absolute confidence.

On a personal level, it would help me stay ahead, continuously adapt, and make strategic career moves. While I may not have superpowers, I do believe in leveraging data and AI to forecast trends and make informed decisions, which is the closest thing to seeing the future in real life.

What tools that make this chatbot?
Gemini AI, Node JS, CSS, HTML
